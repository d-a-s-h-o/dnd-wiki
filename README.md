# D\&Dz

{% hint style="warning" %}
### This wiki is very new, and very little content has been added yet. However, rest assured, I am working through it and it will be completed very soon.

## Projects

### D\&Dz

A suite of browser-based tools for players and DMs of D\&D 5e. You can download the entire project from [https://github.com/d-a-s-h-o/dnd](https://github.com/d-a-s-h-o/dnd) to run a local (offline) copy. You can use the D\&Dz website and you can enhance your Roll20 or Foundry experience with its companion scriptâ€™s features.

### Homebrew

A guide to converting content into the D\&Dz format for use on the website, or through the import features within betteR20 (Roll20) and Plutonium (Foundry VTT).
